# MyGame
This is the first ever project I created using Unity Engine with C#. (Its just a simple fun little game)  
I've tried to mimic the famous android game 'Angry Birds'. This game is pretty similar, except that it runs on windows and has very few levels ðŸ˜….  
  
#### To play this game:
- Download the zip folder locally on your pc.
- Extract the files, and run the .exe file.
- Only works on windows.  
- Hope you like it ðŸ¤—.
